This is a pet project aiming to reproduce a small subset of [downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com)'s
functionalities, while adding support for [solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Warning: don't use this library, it is not even close to be production ready, and I'm not planning to
release it. You think I should? Let me know.
